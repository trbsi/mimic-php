                demonstrate its commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information we
                collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses
                and disclosures. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our application or
                services or transacting business with us. By using our website or application (our "Service"), you are

            <p class="p4 bold">Information we collect about you</p>

            <p class="p5 ft1"><span class="ft3">In General</span>. We may collect information that can identify you such
                as your name and email address ("personal information") and other information that does not identify
                you. We may collect this information through a website or a mobile application. By using the Service,
                you are authorizing us to gather, parse and retain data related to the provision of the Service. When
                you provide personal information through our Service, the information may be sent to servers located in
                the Croatia and countries around the world.</p>

            <p class="p6 ft6 list-item"><span class="ft5">Information you provide</span>. You will be asked to
                allow <?= config("app.name") ?> to collect your location information from your device
                when you download or use the Service. In addition, we may collect and store any personal information you
                provide while using our Service or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such
                as your name, address, email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us,
                financial information. You may also provide us photos, a personal description and information about your
                gender and preferences for recommendations, such as search distance, age range and gender. If you chat
                with other <?= config("app.name") ?> users, you provide us the content of your chats,
                and if you contact us with a customer service or other inquiry, you provide us with the content of that

                technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities on our Service.</p>

            <p class="p9 ft8 list-item"><span class="ft7">Information collected automatically</span>. We automatically
                collect information from your browser or device when you visit our Service. This information could
                include your IP address, device ID and type, your browser type and language, the operating system used
                by your device, access times, your mobile device’s geographic location while our application is actively
                running, and the referring website address.</p>

            <p class="p10 ft1 list-item"><span class="ft10">Cookies and Use of Cookie Data</span>. When you visit our
                Service, we may assign your device one or more cookies to facilitate access to our Service and to
                personalize your experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information
                about your activity on our Service, such as the pages you visit, the time and date of your visits and
                the links you click. If we advertise, we (or third parties) may use certain data collected on our
                Service to show you <?= config("app.name") ?> advertisements on other sites or
                applications.</p>

            <p class="p11 ft1 list-item"><span class="ft10">Pixel tags</span>. We embed pixel tags (also called web
                beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails. These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access
                cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed). We use pixel tags to
                measure the popularity of our features and services. Ad companies also use pixel tags to measure the
                number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).</p>

            <p class="p12 ft1 list-item"><span class="ft10">Mobile Device IDs</span>: If you're using our app, we use
                mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs
                (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and
                track your use of our app. Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted, but Advertising IDs can be
                reset in "Settings" on your iPhone. Ad companies also use device IDs or Advertising IDs to track your
                use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more
                relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage.</p>

                insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a
